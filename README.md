# Knitting Pattern Parser

Given your knitting pattern PDF and size, the parser breaks down the pattern and returns instructions specific to your size
Also has a section-by-section tracker to track the progress of your WIP

Coming up : 
1. [P0] Improve the formatting, and have an overall tracker section
2. [P1] Improved overview section to contain details like gauge, materials, needles, yarn, etc
3. [P2] Improved visualization ( pattern image)
4. [P0] Better retention, if already parsed, make it stick
5. [P0] Row Counter
6. [Wish] Raverly integration
